Description: This package implements and extends the phi statistic as measure of the 
    strength of proportionality between two variables. This approach was proposed by Lovell et al. 
    (2015) in "Proportionality: A Valid Alternative to Correlation for Relative Data", DOI:
    10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075 for use with compositional data, i.e., data that carry only
    relative information (e.g., proportions, percentages, parts-per-million, etc).
